# Reel paper anomaly detections

The aim of the project is to create a mechanism for detecting paper defects on the splicer of a web press in order to minimize the risk of the paper breaking. The solution will be based on paper anomaly detection based on image recognition.

### Web Offset Printing Overview

Web offset is a form of offset printing in which a continuous roll of paper is fed through the printing press. Pages are separated and cut to size after they have been printed. Web offset printing is used for high-volume publications such as mass-market books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs and brochures

The first element of the flow is a Reel Stand/Reel Splicer wchich main task are unwind the paper reel, tension the paper web and keep it at constant tension and
change the reel fully automatically.
